# Travel planner using Graph

[inspo](https://github.com/Nirespire/Dijkstra-Travel-Planner)
**Difficulty level:** Medium
This project aims to help travelers plan optimal travel routes between different locations. It uses graph data structures to represent locations as nodes and paths and the connecting roads or transportation routes as edges. This application will be able to calculate the shortest path between two locations, considering factors like distance, travel time, and cost.

**Learning outcomes:**

- Hands-on experience in working with graph data structures and algorithms
- Learn different types of graphs like directed, undirected, and weighted graphs
- How to represent and traverse graphs using techniques like adjacency lists or matrices
- Implement graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s algorithm, DFS (Depth-First-Search), and BFS (Breadth-First-Search) to find the shortest path between two locations
- Develop skills in data handling, input/output operations, and user interface design

**What it takes to execute this project:**

- Represent locations as nodes in a graph data structure, with edges representing travel routes.
- Assign weights to edges based on distance, travel time, or cost.
- Implement graph traversal algorithms like depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to find possible routes.
- Use shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra’s or A* to find optimal routes based on distance/time/cost.
- Implement data structures like priority queues or heaps for efficient path-finding.
- Handle constraints like budget, travel mode, or stopover preferences.
- Integrate with external APIs for fetching location data, travel information, or real-time updates.
- Provide a user interface for entering source, destination, and preferences, and displaying planned routes.

**Real world application:**

*Navigation systems:* Navigation systems like GPS devices and maps can implement this application to find the best roads for travelers and drivers
*Logistics and supply chain industry:* They can use such systems to optimize their delivery routes for trucks to reduce cost and improve delivery time
*Travel agencies:* These organizations can provide better services by planning efficient travel roads for clients considering different constraints with this application
