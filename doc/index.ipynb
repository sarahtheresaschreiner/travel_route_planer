    "- I decided to use **geopy** for getting the coordinates (longitude & latitude) with Nominatim. It is easy to use and does not need very detailed input and also does not has a strict syntax on the input, which is very User friendly.\n",
    "- For calculating the distance between two points I decided to use **routingpy** with **Valhalla**. It is ideal because it offers the option to create a matrix with the distance of a *list of locations* to a *list of other locations*.\n",
    "    - I chose a community hosted endpoint (https://valhalla.openstreetmap.de/), eventhough it is slower than other options, but for this small project it works good enough and doesn't exceed the limits."
